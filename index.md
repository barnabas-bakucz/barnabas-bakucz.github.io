I am a second-year PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at the Norwegian School of Economics, affiliated with The Choice Lab at the [FAIR research institute](https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/fair/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of behavioral and public economics.  I am mainly interested in using empirical and experimental methods to explore how institutional rules influence individual decision-making and the factors that shape public attitudes toward redistribution.
